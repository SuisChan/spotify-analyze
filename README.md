# Spotify Reverse Engineering tools and scripts
This repository contains tools and scripts used to reverse engineer the Spotify Protocol.
They are used to develop [librespot](https://github.com/plietar/librespot), an open source client implementation.

## spotify-dump
The `spotify-dump` tool intercepts packets by the Spotify desktop client before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted.
It works by patching the `shn_encrypt` and `shn_decrypt` routines of the client at run time.

This currently only works on 64 bit OS X/Linux.

To use, quit the Spotify application, and execute the `dump.sh` script with the path the spotify binary.

```
~/spotify-analyze/dump> ./dump.sh /Applications/Spotify.app/Contents/MacOS/Spotify
```

This will produce a `dump.pcap` in the current directory, which can be analyzed by the `spotify-dissect` tool.

## spotify-dump-http
The `spotify-dump-http` tool sets `CURLOPT_VERBOSE` to `1`, therefore logging to the console every request made with `libcurl`. This allows to analyze *some* of the HTTPS requests.

This has been tested on Linux only.

```
~/spotify-analyze/dump-http> ./patch.sh /usr/bin/spotify
```

## spotify-dissect
The `spotify-dissect` tool is a set of Wireshark dissectors used to analyze packet dumps.

##### MacOS/Linux
To use, run the `dissect.sh` script with the packet dump as an argument.

```
~/spotify-analyze/dissect> ./dissect.sh ../dump/dump.pcap
```

###### Windows
On Windows, run the `dissect.bat` script similarly.

```
~\spotify-analyze\dissect> .\dissect.bat ..\dump\dump.pcap
```

This will start wireshark with the right plugins loaded, and open the packet dump.

## macOS Specific

### Warning: This will make your system insecure. Remove this kernel patch once done with dumping.

Thanks to Apple's tireless efforts to protect us, you can't simply run `./dump.sh /Applications/Spotify.app/Contents/MacOS/Spotify` anymore above 10.12, as the dump.dylib library is unsigned. Self signed certificates manually trusted don't work either, as they don't have Team IDs in them. So the dirty solution is to patch the kernel to disable library validation.

https://github.com/mologie/macos-disable-library-validation gets the job done, just build, install, reboot, dump, uninstall, reboot, dissect. It's really that simple. Think different.
